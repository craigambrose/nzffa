      <h2>Market Report</h2>
      
      <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">
      <tr><td class="y0">
      </div><a name="Industry consolidation, yeah right!"></a> 
      	
      <h3>Industry consolidation, yeah right!</h3>
      <img SRC="/images/design/wee-cone.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" border="1"> <P style="background-color:#ffcc00"><i><b> Domestic markets over the last three months have been dominated by what we might term a recessionary phase with mill slow-downs and closures predominating. For log exporters the scene has been somewhat more positive with a seemingly positive gain in market share leading to improved sales prices and better overall returns to growers. </b></i></p>
      
      My ring around has uncovered at least three mill closures in the last month but some mills are also expanding, adding new equipment and increasing production. This diverse outcome has never seemed more extreme.<br>
      Mill closures usually have usually been forced, meaning that people are unexpectedly out of work and a few people are owed a lot of money they will probably never see. At a national level this is significant, at a local level this is very significant and personal. It is certainly time to be very careful out there. The heartless asset strippers would probably term this period as one of 'industry consolidation'.
      
      <h3>Export log sales</h3>
      Since my February report log export prices have bubbled along with moderate increases on a monthly basis. A reasonable range of prices has been reported this month. This will be due to timing of sales and how both Forex and shipping charters are being managed.<br>
      Shipping costs bottomed out at around US$22 to US$24 a cubic metre for January and February sales but have ballooned back up in recent times to the US$26 to US$30 mark. For the most part charterers have moved to the spot market and as there are plenty of vessels looking for work this allows them some negotiation space. Recent new vessels entering the Handy-class segment are finding few opportunities to scratch their paintwork with the prognosis suggesting a very subdued international demand for the rest of the year. The contrast to this is one report of a vessel not turning up at a New Zealand port for cargo as expected. This is not untypical of spot markets and vessels chasing the best option.
      
      <h3>Species substitution</h3>
      For the first time in a long time we are seeing a very clear species substitution to radiata pine in our key markets of China, Korea and India. All indications are that this growth is sustainable as long as we match the competitor species prices, maintain an aggressive price hold or increase strategy and do not over-supply the markets. This may mean a big change in attitude for some New Zealand suppliers.<br>
      Meanwhile China is proving to be one of our leading stars with a three dollar a cubic metre increase in sales prices for each of March and April. Volumes into this key market are on the increase and the hunger for our radiata pine looks to be increasing at an appreciable rate.
      
      <h3>Domestic log market</h3>
      A common thread running through the log prices by region is a reduction in pruned log value and demand. One or two exceptions have been uncovered with a few log export orders taking up the supply slack. In general the higher end value pruned logs is not being actively sought in any region. For the most part prices are off by five dollars a tonne.<br>
      Small branched framing logs, particularly in the larger diameter classes, vary in demand and prices are generally holding firm. I say generally because a couple of regions have reported some downward pressure on these logs. Suppliers have stated that they are not concerned about a reduced demand profile in the higher end unpruned domestic log as there is always plenty of space at the wharf. My hope is that these suppliers do not have short term memories and do not walk away from the much more important domestic market.
      
      <h3>Complexity and cost</h3>
      Timber stress grading and treatment rules continue to add a layer of complexity and cost to growers, particularly in the South Island. The continuing absurdity surrounding stress grading must eventually play out to a level of common sense that has not been a significant component of the policy maker's rule books in recent times. In the meantime forest owners face continuing discounting for so-called low density logs forced on them by this unnecessary policy poltergeist.
      
      <h3>Some good news</h3>
      Some sawmills are changing tack revisiting the lower end log quality options and turning them into various products and commodities which focus on the wood between the knots. In terms of future options this is good news.<br>
      The changing scene as it effects New Zealand sawmills is clearly about marketing. Those with a sound portfolio of export customers are surviving and in some cases growing their business. This is no mean feat in the current climate.
      Those with a focus on doing what they always did are getting a pasting.

      <hr><h3>Natives for Timber or Amenity</h3>                                       \r\n\
      <b>Introduction</b>\r\n\
      <div align=right>June 2008</div><br>\r\n\
      Nothing can be more rewarding for a forester than creating and nurturing a native \r\n\
      plantation from 10 years on their size, growth rate, form \r\n\
      and rapid maturation looks and feels more like our natural bush!!! But behind every success \r\n\
      story there is a lot of work, and many others that \r\n\
      have failed!! This article is written on the assumption you are interested in planting a 0.4 \r\n\
      hectare block or more. Naturally established natives \r\n\
      are generally not included in this summary. Nursery grown stock is not covered.<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <b>Planning</b><br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Natives take a long time to establish. It may be 3-4 years after planting before you can be \r\n\
      assured they are reasonably established. That \r\n\
      translates into high costs \x13 allow $9-$10 per tree or shrub! A budget will be imperative to see \r\n\
      you have enough money!!<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      But before you plant, check your local District Plan carefully! Don\x19t just take your council \r\n\
      employee\x19s information as gospel either. A recent \r\n\
      survey found many council employees gave out incorrect information on native plantings. \r\n\
      Get a copy of the District Plan and research it \r\n\
      carefully. Or talk to someone who has. Most District Plans have scattered, unrelated and \r\n\
      conflicting references to forestry, and natives. Check the \r\n\
      definitions! Forestry and natives may or may not be mutually exclusive terms. Some District \r\n\
      Plans do not allow cutting down of any natives, \r\n\
      planted or natural, over 3 metres in height. If you need a consent, get one! After your \r\n\
      research, get a written affirmation from the council as to \r\n\
      what the rules are, before you plant one stick, and keep this copy for ever! Also, check with \r\n\
      your Regional Councils \x13 they are usually more \r\n\
      helpful but only cover water and pest management concerns.<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Outside of local council rules, generally the law; allows you to harvest native trees that have \r\n\
      been planted unless you give up that right. Try to \r\n\
      get the council to write down or \x18register\x19 the details of the natives you have \r\n\
      planted.<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <b>Tax Deductibility</b><br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      This varies according to whether you are in business (by IRD rules) as a farmer, a forester, or \r\n\
      a property developer! To be a forester, 2 hectares \r\n\
      is often considered the minimum forested area, to show you are not a hobbyist. If the district \r\n\
      plan disallows cutting down trees at the time you \r\n\
      put your plantation in, you will not have a forestry business!<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Most plantings will hopefully be deductible check with your chartered accountant consider \r\n\
      using a company as natives are long term, and \r\n\
      share ownership can protect you from a deemed sale. For your protection, make sure any \r\n\
      purchase of an existing block (including natural bush) \r\n\
      has an agreed valuation on the trees in the sale and purchase agreement. Forestry rights\x19may \r\n\
      also be useful planning tools.<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <b>Planting</b><br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The aim is to effect rapid crown cover, self sustaining growth and to shut out weeds. \r\n\
      Anything over 2m x 2m initial planting spacing \r\n\
      compromises this. Plant a tree height that can quickly get over grass height, but will not be \r\n\
      socketed by wind and not sulk! Unless you are \r\n\
      coastal, or a beech grower(!), hardwoods often require an already established nurse \r\n\
      crop...quite a management art that!<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <b>Weeds</b><br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Grass is your biggest threat in the first few years. Later on blackberry eventually establishes \r\n\
      with any extra light and pulls down established trees \r\n\
      - hence rapid canopy closure is the aim. The shrubby natives give your best crown closure. \r\n\
      Gorse should be cleared before planting, and \r\n\
      followed up with spot sprays.<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \r\n\
      Roundup and Galant (kills grasses only) can be used from planting and onwards. Residual \r\n\
      weedicides knock natives. The spots around trees \r\n\
      need to be at least 1m in diameter to stop grass falling in \x13 wider on the high side if sloping \r\n\
      ground. Four to five sprays may be needed \r\n\
      through to year 3, depending on growth. Costs 30&cent;-35&cent; per plant per time sprayed. \r\n\
      Weedmats and mulches can be tried but they may stop \r\n\
      summer rainfall being effective unless well designed and may be more labour intensive. \r\n\
      Anyone want to try layers of plastic from balewrap with \r\n\
      a few pitch fork holes in it, for aiding water run in?<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <b>Tending</b><br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The jury is out on this still! Much will depend on your management. Pure specie stands will \r\n\
      require thinning. Mixed timber trees with fast growth \r\n\
      shrubs may well require earlier releasing and then later thinning. Blocks close to existing \r\n\
      natural bush stands will more quickly have natural \r\n\
      bush species introducing themselves. To make sure you have sufficient timber crop trees, \r\n\
      pruning may well be wise. Prune similar to that done \r\n\
      for Acacia melanoxylon: i.e. three rules:<ol>\r\n\
      <li>If a branch is over 3 cm in diameter, take it off!\r\n\
      <li>If the branch is 30 degrees or less to the main stem it is a steep angled branch; take if \r\n\
      off no matter what the size!\r\n\
      <li>Check the top 3 metres of the tree and form prune, so that you leave only one leader, \r\n\
      now! All the rest of the branches should be retained \r\n\
      to help maintain the rapid growth you want.</ol>\r\n\
      For older existing trees of poor form \x13 give them a go \x13 prune them now \x13 you\x19ll always look \r\n\
      back later glad that you did. Take up that jacksaw \r\n\
      or chainsaw!<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Final spacing?? Check known natural stands final spacing of the age you hope to harvest at. \r\n\
      Acacia melanoxylon growers aim for fast fat trees in \r\n\
      35-40 years. They want one good 6m log-tree about 200 stems per hectare final spacing. \r\n\
      Podocarps can grow closer than that, and have better \r\n\
      apical dominance and naturally good timber form!<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Consider tending cost!!! Most natives respond to pruning. But with the long wait, will the \r\n\
      outlay justify the cost? Should you management system \r\n\
      reduce this? (e.g. planting into manuka/kanuka? Will you be patient for results? Will higher \r\n\
      fire risk be a threat?) Prune for love and it won\x19t \r\n\
      matter!!<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <b>Species Choice</b><br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Totara and Kauri: Well known, fast, some research results available already, prime timber \r\n\
      species.<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Silver Beech and Black Beech: Have surprisingly fast growth rates most places in the North \r\n\
      Island. Red beech is less reliable to establish. Correct \r\n\
      beech soil mycorhiza should be included with your planted trees. Check what your \r\n\
      nurseryman does (or knows!)<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Kahikatea and Tanekaha: Less favoured timber species but fast growth in a wide variety of \r\n\
      sites. Don\x19t stake drooping tanakaha leaders. They\x19ll \r\n\
      right themselves.<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Karamu: One of the fastest, best performing shrubby canopy covers!<br><br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Puriri, Rewarewa, Kokekohe & Mangeao: Most favoured manageable hardwoods for the North \r\n\
      Island.<br><br>\r\n\

      <h3>Gisborne Conference 2009</h3>
      Congratulations to the Gisborne-East Coast Branch for a very successful annual conference. Nick Seymour and his very efficient team can feel well satisfied with their efforts in showcasing both farm forestry and land-use in the East Coast region.<br>
      In addition to the normal business sessions, dinners, and award presentations, conference attendees visited a wide range of locations. The visit to Ray and Grace Newman's property Koro Station was memorable not only for their enthusiasm and sheer hard work but also the tenacity needed to successfully farm there.<br>
      Another very interesting visit was the trip up the East Coast to Ruatoria to view and get a feel for the East Coast Forestry Project. This project aims to reduce erosion on susceptible land by retirement and afforestation. We certainly appreciated the scale of the problem. For example, it is estimated that there are around 10,000 hectares of eroding gully systems which have been treated to a greater or lesser extent.<br>
      Since 1961, around 80,000 hectares have been planted to control this erosion, mostly radiata which has been managed for timber. High logging and transport costs will probably result in much of this forest not being economic to harvest. In response to this it was encouraging to see higher value species being planted, especially costal redwood. This long lived stable tree with a very extensive root system would seem ideally suited to much of this area and a recent sawing study from trees grown at Mangatu confirm that a high value timber can be produced from it.<br>
      At the end of the conference I felt that it was a great pity that more of the wider farming community had not seen and experienced the benefits that flow from intelligently integrating trees and forestry with other land uses. The conference, along with the Tree Grower, is one of the most influential means the NZFFA has to promote itself and its objectives to other land users. Therein lies a challenge for both future conference organising committees and the executive.
      
      <h3>Award winners</h3>
      I would like to congratulate this year's award winners - as with past winners they have demonstrated once again the relevance of the farm forestry model in aiding good land management and sustainability. The question for farm forestry and farm foresters is how we encourage more landowners to adopt our model. The NZFFA is very grateful to Husqvarna for their continued support of the farm forester of the year, the Landcare Trust for their environmental award and Audrey Hay for her award to support and encourage younger tree planters.
      
      <h3>Emissions Trading Scheme</h3>
      To date the ETS is following the timeline set out in last year's legislation. So far the government has not indicated that there will be major changes to the Act, in fact they are signalling that the forestry component of it is likely to remain mostly unchanged. Recently eight million New Zealand Units were released and the first trades have occured at $20 a tonne of carbon.<br>
      For most farm foresters there are still two very important deadlines. Firstly if you own less than fifty hectares of pre-1990 forest and wish to apply for an exemption to the ETS, then you have until the 30 June 2009. All pre-1990 forests or stands greater than two hectares are by default part of the ETS. Secondly all pre-1990 forest owners have until the 31 July 2009 to apply for a free allocation of NZ Units.<br>
      MAF also has information available on its web site www.maf.govt.nz and via its 0800 CLIMATE hotline. The take home message is that unless you are a pre-1990 forest owner, there is no real urgency to do anything yet other than keeping up to date with developments.<br>
      Pre-1990 forest owners with less than 50 hectares should now be thinking about whether or not to apply for an exemption to the ETS. Details of the application process, timelines, and information required from pre-1990 forest owners applying for a free allocation of NZ Units are expected any day now. The NZFFA will continue to take a very active role in promoting the ETS to members as more of the detail is clarified.

      <h3>A cautious start to the year</h3>\r\n\
      It has been a somewhat cautious start to the New Year for both the agriculture and forestry sector \x13 this caution will have been exacerbated further with the recent announcement of a drop in the dairy payout. In the forestry sector, both export and domestic log sales are still occurring, albeit at a reduced level. Apart from harvesting and replanting, there is little enthusiasm for any new forestry activity. This is a major concern to both government and policy makers. <br>\r\n\
      The industry believed that the ETS would give it a kick start and is still hoping that this will be the case following the upcoming ministerial review. The NZFFA is looking forward to both a speedy conclusion to this review of the ETS, and the rapid implementation of any changes so that it is in place for the 2010 planting season.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <h3>Conference 2009</h3>\r\n\
      Planning is at well advanced stage for this conference. The Gisborne Branch has put together a very interesting range of field days and events for conference attendees. The registration form is in this <i>Tree Grower</i> and also available on line at www.nzffa.org.nz. Nick Seymour, the conference chairman, is still concerned that the effect of an increase in cost registration, Gisborne\x19s isolation and the current economic downturn will deter conference goers. So let us help him out by planning to attend and registering now.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <h3>Association issues</h3>\r\n\
      Following the Gisborne conference, Bruce Bulloch will be \x18retiring\x19 from his roles as Treasurer, Office Manager and the NZFFA \x18go to\x19 person. Over the least eight years Bruce has done a fantastic job of managing both the finances and the Wellington office. His departure will bring about some changes in Wellington \x13 these changes are currently being worked through by the executive and will be discussed in some detail at the conference.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <h3>Emissions Trading Scheme</h3>\r\n\
      The flagship of the Government initiatives to address climate change is its Emissions Trading Scheme or ETS. It came into force on the 26 September 2008 and is still in force even though there has been a change of government and ministerial review ordered. So far the government has not indicated that there will be major changes to the Act, in fact they are signalling that the forestry component of it is likely to remain mostly unchanged.<br>\r\n\
      For most farm foresters there are still two very important deadlines in place. Firstly, if you own less than fifty hectares of pre-1990 forest and wish to apply for an exemption to the ETS, then you have until the 30 June 2009 to do so. Secondly, all pre-1990 forest owners have until the 31 July 2009 to apply for a free allocation of the NZ Units.<br>\r\n\
      MAF also has extensive information available on its web site www.maf.govt.nz and its 0800 CLIMATE hotline is also very good.<br>\r\n\
      The take-home message is that unless you are a pre-1990 forest owner, there is no real urgency to do anything yet, other than keeping up to date with developments. Pre-1990 forest owners with less than 50 hectares should now be thinking about whether or not to apply for an exemption to the ETS. Details of the application process, timelines, and information required from pre-1990 forest owners applying for a free allocation of NZ units are currently expected to be available late April 2009. The NZFFA will take a very active role in promoting the ETS to members once more of the detail has been clarified.\r\n\

      \t\t\r\n\
      It has not been a vintage year for farming and farm forestry \x13 dairying was probably the \r\n\
      exception. Yet only two months ago the expectations for the next year were quite \r\n\
      encouraging. What a difference now. Phrases such as credit crunch, banking crisis, recession \r\n\
      and even depression have replaced those expectations. Add in climate change and an \r\n\
      election and it is anyone\x19s guess as to what the next year holds for farming and farm \r\n\
      forestry.<br><h4>Conference 2009</h4>Planning is well advanced for next year\x19s \r\n\
      conference in Gisborne. The conference committee have put together a varied and interesting \r\n\
      programme for us. The conference programme and registration form are included in this \r\n\
      magazine so please register now. <br><h4>Emissions Trading Scheme</h4>The flagship \r\n\
      of the government initiatives to address climate change is its Emissions Trading Scheme or \r\n\
      ETS. It was passed on 26 September with over 700 amendments. Of all those amendments, \r\n\
      the two most important for farm foresters relate to those who are pre-1990 forest owners. \r\n\
      There are now two deadlines in place. First, if you own less than fifty hectares and wish to \r\n\
      apply for an exemption to the ETS, then you have until the 30 June 2009. Secondly, all pre-\r\n\
      1990 forest owners have until 30 June 1990 to apply for a free allocation of NZ Units. <br>\r\n\
      The ETS is very complex and Piers Maclaren in his unique style simplifies it in an article on \r\n\
      page 17. MAF also has extensive information available on its website. The message is that \r\n\
      unless you are a pre-1990 forest owner, there is no real urgency to do anything yet. I would \r\n\
      strongly advise anyone to wait and see how things develop. The NZFFA will take an active role \r\n\
      in promoting the ETS to members once more of the detail has been clarified. <br>\r\n\
      <h4>Afforestation Grants Scheme (AGS)</h4>This is another initiative announced by the \r\n\
      government to address the effects of climate change. The AGS will provide funds for new \r\n\
      plantings of trees on land that was not in forest at 1 January 1990. The AGS is split into two \r\n\
      pools with half being allocated to Regional Councils for their sustainable land management \r\n\
      projects and the remainder to a public pool. In the latter, applicants tender for as much \r\n\
      funding as they wish with these tenders ranked according to the benefits of the planting and \r\n\
      the tender price. <br>The AGS is targeting areas that are erosion prone, areas where a \r\n\
      Regional Council requires forest cover, and areas where forest cover will improve water \r\n\
      quality and enhance bio-diversity. The minimum application for the AGS is five hectares and \r\n\
      it must be established at a minimum stocking of 800 stems per hectare. A wide range of \r\n\
      species can be planted including radiata pine, eucalypts, cypresses, redwoods and \r\n\
      indigenous species. Successful tender applicants sign an agreement which is valid for 10 \r\n\
      years. Then you are free to enter the ETS, harvest or change land-use. <br>During the 10 \r\n\
      years the government will accumulate any carbon credits and also accept and liability for \r\n\
      carbon losses due to fire, wind or other natural disasters. The results of the first tender \r\n\
      round were notified in August with the successful tender at approximately $1,800 per \r\n\
      hectare. <br>I would like to congratulate both the government and MAF for the AGS. I think \r\n\
      it is a very good scheme, although it might not suit everyone. If you have eligible land and \r\n\
      would like to plant some trees, I encourage you to consider applying for a grant. <br>\r\n\
      <h4>Environmental certification</h4>The NZFFA, with funding from FIDA, has \r\n\
      commissioned a study on the benefits of environmental certification for its members and the \r\n\
      feasibility of a NZFFA Group Certification Scheme. Certification has been around now for \r\n\
      many years with most of the larger forest growers now certified with the Forest Stewardship \r\n\
      Council (FSC). This is in stark contrast to the small grower where virtually none are certified. \r\n\
      To date this has not been detrimental to the small grower but there is a distinct possibility \r\n\
      that it could be in the future. The demand for certified wood seems to be on the increase \r\n\
      and linked in with this are a chain of custody issues.<br>Currently all certified forests are \r\n\
      assessed against an International Standard as there is no agreed New Zealand national \r\n\
      standard. There was a very serious attempt to negotiate a national standard from 2000/03. \r\n\
      However there was no agreement and it has been on hold for the last five years. Last month, \r\n\
      representatives of NZFFA, NZFOA and environmental NGOs met again to see if a way could be \r\n\
      found to restart the negotiation on a national standard. This meeting went very well, there \r\n\
      was considerable goodwill around the table and all the participants were optimistic that \r\n\
      progress can be made. In my next report I would like to be able to report that we have made \r\n\
      some progress.\r\n\

      <h4>Ashburton celebrates 50 years</h4>\r\n\
      Congratulations go to the Ashburton Branch which celebrated its 50th anniversary on 22 \r\n\
      June. The day started with a visit to the property and plantings by the original Branch \r\n\
      President, Bill Buchan. Ashburton is now the sixth branch to have reached this milestone, and \r\n\
      to have made it is testament to the commitment and enthusiasm of members and Branch \r\n\
      committees during this time. Congratulations also go to Mark Robbins who was made a life \r\n\
      member on the day.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <h4>Farm forestry awards</h4>\r\n\
      Nominations are currently being sought for the 2009 North and South Island Farm Forester of \r\n\
      the Year, the Michael Hay Award awarded to a younger member of the NZFFA, and the \r\n\
      Transpower Landcare Trust Grants Award for innovation in sustainable farm forestry. It is \r\n\
      very important that the NZFFA continues to showcase and promote the outstanding efforts of \r\n\
      the membership through these awards. I encourage all Branches to consider nominating \r\n\
      appropriate members. Nomination forms can be obtained from Branch Secretaries or from \r\n\
      the website.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <h4>Conferences</h4>\r\n\
      Denis Hocking and I recently attended the NZ Institute of Forestry Conference in Palmerston \r\n\
      North where the theme was Forestry and Agriculture - Collaborating for Sustainability. A \r\n\
      wide range of speakers discussed land-use issues including soil erosion, nutrient run-off, \r\n\
      maintaining water quality and methods to address these issues. These are not new, with farm \r\n\
      forestry being held up as the best model to address them.<br>\r\n\
      There was a similar message from the Environmental Defence Society June conference \r\n\
      \x18Conflict in Paradise - the Transforming of Rural New Zealand\x19 attended by Jim Cook. Just \r\n\
      how the NZFFA can capitalise on this on this awareness is uncertain at this stage but at least \r\n\
      we know we are on the right track. It is likely that carbon trading at the ETS will provide an \r\n\
      opportunity. Until the appropriate legislation is passed and there is some certainty, it is still a \r\n\
      case of \x18wait and see\x19.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <h4>SFF Project - Adding to the farm forestry model</h4>\r\n\
      The NZFFA was successful with an application in the latest round of the Sustainable Farm \r\n\
      Fund to continue development of the farm forestry model. More specifically this application \r\n\
      was to fund collection of information to add to the model. Updating the web site, and in \r\n\
      particular the farm forestry model, is part of a strategy for a simple clear message promoting \r\n\
      the benefits of farm forestry.\r\n\
      \tIt needs to be supported with well-researched good practical examples that are easy to \r\n\
      follow and convincing. If we can do nothing this well we will succeed in promoting farm \r\n\
      forestry to a wider audience. This project is being progressed by Dean Satchell and Vivienne \r\n\
      Mclean - you can see Dean\x19s influence already in the new look web site.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <h4>Eucalypts in New Zealand</h4>\r\n\
      The potential rewards for growing eucalypts in New Zealand has captivated a great number \r\n\
      of farm foresters and foresters alike. The allure of very rapid growth, attractive high quality \r\n\
      and durable timber along with pleasing aesthetics are just some of the many reasons for \r\n\
      planting eucalypts. There have been many notable advocates in the past for eucalypts, \r\n\
      including Neil Barr and Harry Bunn.<br>\r\n\
      \tThe situation is very similar today within the membership of the Eucalypt Action Group \r\n\
      and the diverse species theme of Future Forest Research. However, with the benefit of \r\n\
      hindsight, it is fair to say that the genus has not yet lived up to expectations. As with all \r\n\
      generalities, there are notable exceptions and it has been these that have fuelled the \r\n\
      continued planting of eucalypts.<br>\r\n\
      \tNew Zealand forestry has been very successful with radiata and a \x18one size fits all \r\n\
      approach\x19. There has also been a tendency to try and grow eucalypts similarly, and this is \r\n\
      probably the main reason for eucalypts under-achieving. Eucalypts are fairly site specific and \r\n\
      while there are over 600 different species, there is a growing awareness that if they are sited \r\n\
      correctly, they can be very rewarding to grow. In addition, different species can have vastly \r\n\
      different timber properties which present enormous challenges for use. But there are some \r\n\
      that are reasonably straight forward to deal with that will provide timbers with exactly the \r\n\
      properties the world says it wants.<br>\r\n\
      \tMention eucalypts to a forester and the first thing they will think of is pests and \r\n\
      diseases. This is not without foundation. Many of the species that have been widely planted \r\n\
      in the past have succumbed to different pests and diseases - but not all species and not on \r\n\
      all sites. The take home message is we need to think locally when planting eucalypts and \r\n\
      select species that are appropriate to the site, its soil, temperature, rainfall and aspect.\r\n\

      <h4>Conference another success</h4>\r\n\
      Congratulations to the Central Canterbury Branch for a very successful annual conference. \r\n\
      Brian Dixon and his very efficiency in showcasing farm forestry in Central Canterbury. In \r\n\
      addition to the normal business sessions, dinners and award presentation, conference \r\n\
      attendees visited a wide range of locations. These included a private native reserve, joint \r\n\
      venture forests, current research trial and a high country station. The visit to John and \r\n\
      Rosalie Wardle's property was memorable, not only for the enthusiasm and shear hard work, \r\n\
      but also for their contribution to alternative management regimes for both beach and \r\n\
      radiata.<br>\r\n\
      At the end of the conference I felt that it was a great pity that more of the wider farming \r\n\
      community had not seen and experienced the benefits that flow from intelligently integrating \r\n\
      trees and forestry with other land uses. The conference along with the Tree Grower, is one of \r\n\
      the most influential means that the NZFFA has to promote itself and its objectives to other \r\n\
      land users. Therein lies a challenge for both future conference orgainising committees and \r\n\
      the executive. <br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <h4>Award winners</h4>\r\n\
      I would like to congratulate this year's award winners. As with past winners they have \r\n\
      demonstrated once again the relevance of the farm forestry model in aiding good land \r\n\
      management and sustainability. The question for farm forestry and farm foresters is how do \r\n\
      we encourage more land owners to adopt our model. The NZFFA is very greatful to \r\n\
      Husqvarna for their continued support of the farm forester of the year, transpower and the \r\n\
      Landcare Trust for their environmental award and Audrey Hay for her new award to support \r\n\
      and encourage younger tree planters. <br>\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <h4>Agriculture carbon footprint</h4>\r\n\
      I have no doubt that most farm foresters will be following the current debate on the \r\n\
      Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) and its effect on the agricultural sector. There are many \r\n\
      predictions on what this impact might be -- ranging from little or no impact through to \r\n\
      predictions that much of New Zealand agricultural future will be at risk under the conditions \r\n\
      prevailing during 2006/07. As the debate continues, farm foresters are left wondering why \r\n\
      the practical benefits of farm forestry are only paid lip-service to by the schemes designers, \r\n\
      while at the same time much is made of yet to be developed new research and future \r\n\
      technological advances. <br>\r\n\
      There is no question that more trees and forestry are absolutely essential if New Zealand is \r\n\
      ever going to be able to claim something akin to being sustainable. This is not just about \r\n\
      balancing our carbon emissions. The country also needs more trees to protect its soils, \r\n\
      enhance water quality, protect indigenous biodiversity and as shelter, shade or even \r\n\
      emergency fodder for animal welfare. <br>\r\n\
      Afforestation should not be considered in isolation, but it must be a key part of any strategy \r\n\
      to tackle agricultural emissions. Looking at current sheep and beef country, if 10 per cent \r\n\
      was in forestry, this would roughly balance the emissions from that industry for 30 to 40 \r\n\
      years. I would have thought this was a very reasonable objective to aim for. Most in sheep \r\n\
      and beef farm foresters would claim that 10 per cent is very easily attained and has minimal \r\n\
      or no effect on farm productivity. With some imagination, I am sure farm forestry would also \r\n\
      offer other agricultural sectors, such as dairying and cropping, the opportunity to offset \r\n\
      emissions. <br>\r\n\
      New Zealand used to be regarded as a world leader in farm forestry, but over the last decade \r\n\
      interest has waned. We have lost our pre-eminent position, and we are now paying the price, \r\n\
      be it in carbon changes, soil erosion, animal welfare or in rural amenity and landscape \r\n\
      values. There has never been a stronger case for tree planting and New Zealand has one of \r\n\
      the best tree growing environments in the world. The NZFAA's collective experience in \r\n\
      planting, and managing a wide range of tree species in an even wider range of environments \r\n\
      is a national asset. I would like to encourage the ETS designers to understand farm forestry, \r\n\
      and why it has been successful and than to try to incorporate it in their scheme.\r\n\

      <h3>What Is the Farm Forestry Model?</h3>
      The Farm Forestry Model represents the accumulated knowledge and experience of NZ Farm Forestry Association members &#151; practical, high performing farmers and rural landowners, with over 50 years of growing trees for profit (and pleasure) as an integral part of their long term commitment to sustainable land management.<br><br>
      In fact, we're proud to say Association members have been practising integrated land use strategies for decades, long before the concepts of 'sustainability' and 'environmental sustainability' achieved their current prominence.<br><br>
      Today, trees have an even more vital role to play in offsetting the impacts of climate change.

    - Trees provide a large range on environmental benefits. Besides being the "lungs of the planet", trees and forests hold soil together, preventing erosion and cycling nutrients thus preventing nutrient and soil loss. Water quality is thus improved. Biodiversity increases in forests and trees provide sanctuaries for wildlife.

      <h4>Planting for timber and shelter in Otago</h4>
      
      <img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 310px; height: 283px; float: left; margin-right: 5px;" alt="" src="/images/design/DSC_40050748.jpg">When John and Heather Prebble bought their farm at Mt Blue, Dunback, in
      East Otago around 30 years ago, there weren&rsquo;t too many trees
      in the landscape. The urgent priority was to establish a buffer against
      the notorious nor-westers, and the next five years saw nearly 3.2 km of
      shelterbelts planted to protect stock, crops and their home. Later the
      emphasis moved to timber production &ndash; today there&rsquo;s
      over 30ha of woodlots, including radiata, macrocarpa and
      eucalyptus&nbsp;as well as poplars planted for fodder.<br>
      
      The landscape has been softened and tamed by the plantings, and the
      gentle rural outlook is now a picture postcard of the farm forestry
      model in action&hellip; trees planted for all the right reasons,
      enhancing a productive livestock operation.<br>
      
      John and Heather now lease the farm to their son Mark, but their vision
      and goals for the land haven&rsquo;t changed over the decades.<br><br>
      
      John is very clear about his farming philosophy, driven by his
      over-riding goal to develop a sustainable farming system that takes
      account of the climatic conditions:<br>
      
      <ul>
      
        <li>To farm the property in a sustainable manner using inputs in relation to carrying capacity</li><br>
      
        <li>To look after the soils by disturbing them as little as possible, with maximum use of direct drilling</li><br>
      
        <li>To produce quality stock and get satisfaction from farming, and</li><br>
      
        <li>To produce satisfactory financial returns.</li>
      
      </ul>
      
      And he&rsquo;s adamant that planting trees has played a vital role
      in enhancing the farm&rsquo;s performance.<br>
      
      <h4>Land description</h4>
      
      The farm totals some 631 hectares, with soils comprising Claremont on
      the downs and limestone on the hill country.<br>
      
      <img style="width: 539px; height: 206px; float: left; margin-right: 4px;" alt="" src="/images/design/prebble_scan_2B_1.jpg" border="1">Altitude
      ranges from 61m asl up to 471m asl, from
      the flats and rolling
      downs to steeper hill country. Approximately 160ha of developed,
      rolling to steep downs planted in modern pasture grasses are fenced
      into 23 paddocks, and around 440ha of over-sown and top-dressed tussock
      country are fenced into 6 [now 8?] blocks. There&rsquo;s also a 31
      ha quarry and lime works on the property.<br><br>
      
      Despite frequent dry spells no irrigation is required, with sufficient
      stock water available from county schemes and the farm&rsquo;s own
      springs.<br>
      [farm map]<br>
      
      <h4>Climate</h4>
      
      Temperature is described as a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; 30+
      degrees in summer, with frosts in winter.<br>
      
      Rainfall averages 650mm, unevenly spread, with yearly totals ranging
      from 500mm &ndash; 1000mm. A dry summer period can be expected most
      years, with the occasional severe drought, and it&rsquo;s rainfall
      that dictates the carrying capacity of the property, with a tendency to
      carry conservative stock numbers.<br>
      
      <h4>Farm Operation<img style="border: 1px solid ; margin-left: 5px; width: 200px; height: 130px; float: right;" alt="" src="/images/design/IMG_0745.jpg"></h4>
      
      The farm now runs 1750 ewes and 400 hoggets plus 75 beef cows and
      winter calves for sale in spring.<br>
      
      Brassicas&nbsp;&nbsp; swedes, turnips, kale and rape
      &ndash; are planted for summer lamb feed and winter feed. All crops
      are direct drilled where possible, although some conventional sowing is
      still done depending on circumstances.<br><br>
      
      <h3>The many roles of trees</h3>
      
      Trees were initially planted to provide shelter to enhance the
      property, with woodlots for profit sited to make maximum use of poorer
      land and also to provide shelter. All up over 34ha of woodlots,
      including radiata, macrocarpa and eucalyptus, have been planted over
      the years, along with 3.2km of shelterbelts and 1.5ha of fodder poplars.<br>
      
      <h4>Shelter</h4>
      
      <img style="width: 163px; height: 413px; float: left; margin-right: 5px;" alt="" src="/images/design/IMG_0746.jpg">Having planted
      around 3.2 km of shelter belts as one of his first
      priorities on taking over the farm, John Prebble just shakes his head
      when the subject of ripping out shelter for dairy conversions comes up.
      He says although he hasn&rsquo;t tried to quantify the benefits of
      shelter on the property, the sheltered paddocks are now &ldquo;the
      best on the place&rdquo;. Shelterbelts are a mix of P.
      radiata/arizonica, Flevo poplars, P. muricata/arizonica planted in
      1981-185 with some Leighton Green and Western Red Cedar planted in 1992
      (Figure 1).<br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      
      Visiting in November, with signs of a possible summer drought already
      concerning the Prebbles, the shelter effect was obvious. The Tank
      Paddock had been sown in kale two days previously. Whereas all the
      other paddocks were &ldquo;dry as a bone&rdquo; according to
      John, a quick probe with his pocket knife showed that this paddock,
      virtually surrounded on four sides by shelter, still had moisture in
      it. [shot of pocketknife and moisture]<br>
      
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve noticed in the last few years, particularly
      during the last couple of dry autumns, this one is the only one with
      any green on it left on the place,&rdquo; he says.
      <h4>Woodlots</h4>
      
      <img style="border: 1px solid ; margin-right: 5px; width: 195px; height: 348px; float: left;" alt="" src="/images/design/IMG_0737.jpg">All
      told some 34 ha
      of woodlots &ndash; mainly radiata and
      macrocarpa, plus a small area of eucalyptus have
      been planted for timber production, starting in 1989 and continuing
      with annual plantings through to 1997 (Figure 2).<br><br>
      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 2:&nbsp; WOODLOT PLANTINGS</span><br>
      
      <img style="width: 676px; height: 277px;" alt="" src="/images/design/Prebbles_fig2.jpg"><br>
      
      The oldest block, radiata pine planted in 1989, is now 20 years old and
      the trees are growing well. Planted at 10 x 2 as an agroforestry block,
      pruned at 4-5m and thinned to 240 sph, the GF22 trees are showing good
      growth and form. This woodlot has a site index of 31 (307m3), which
      John says is high for the district, the usual range being more like
      25-31. Branching is quite fine, and there&rsquo;s not a lot of
      taper.<br><br>
      
      When the trees were about 15m it was particularly good shelter at
      shearing time, although that advantage isn&rsquo;t so great now
      that the grass cover has reduced.<br><br>
      
      This block will be the first to be harvested, although that&rsquo;s
      some years off yet and (understandably) the Prebbles say they will be
      interested to see what the log prices will be like then.<br><br>
      
      <img style="border: 1px solid ; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; width: 400px; height: 267px; float: left;" alt="" src="/images/design/logging_2006.jpg">Meanwhile
      they
      have already experienced the practical realities of
      harvesting, having sold some timber in 2006 after taking out a couple
      of radiata shelter belts.<br><br>
      
      All up some 400t of logs were extracted, with a net return of around
      $9,000. John says the best price for the sawlogs came from local mill
      Hewvan Timber, realising 82t of S grade at $39 per tonne. The rest were
      exported through Port Chalmers, a mix of Export A, K and K1 grades.<br><br>
      
      <img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 195px; height: 260px; float: right;" alt="" src="/images/design/DSC_40000743.jpg">It was a
      good price at the
      time for the sawlogs, says John, although
      tinged with some disappointment at the volumes. The Prebbles had
      expected they would get 150m3 or more in sawlogs, but a lot of the
      pruned logs just didn&rsquo;t quite reach length specifications. It
      was a good lesson learned.<br><br>
      
      &ldquo;Being shelterbelts we hadn&rsquo;t consciously pruned
      them up to 6m and a lot of them were falling just that much
      short,&rdquo; recalls John. &ldquo;It was just that last ring
      of knots that was putting them out.&rdquo;<br><br>
      
      An unexpected bonus was being able to recover timber from three poplars
      that would otherwise have been smashed when the radiata was felled. The
      contractor felled them and pulled the logs out into the paddock.
      They&rsquo;ve since been milled and treated for the top of a new
      deck.<br><br>
      
      In the mid to late 90s the Prebbles carried out three joint venture
      plantings, in partnership with ???. The joint venture structure brought
      in useful cash flow that kept the planting momentum going [is this
      true? need more here!].<br>
      
      <h4>Macrocarpas</h4>
      
      Some of the Prebbles earliest woodlot plantings were
      macrocarpas. Longwoods from Edendale Nurseries in
      1989 and more Longwoods from Fords Nurseries in 1990.<br><br>
      
      <img style="border: 1px solid ; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 5px; width: 380px; height: 171px; float: left;" alt="" src="/images/design/DSC_39850728.jpg">The
      onset of
      canker in XXX had John scratching his head, until the
      Prebble&rsquo;s forestry advisor, Dave Pearson, of Plantation
      Management Services came across an old article describing the use of
      boron as a remedy for canker.<br><br>
      
      Cypress canker (Seiridium cardinale and S.unicorne) is widespread
      throughout New Zealand, and can kill young trees. For those growing
      cypresses for timber production the impact can be severe, with the
      disease reducing returns due to malformations and stem cankers. The
      usual strategy is one of prevention, managed by selecting the
      appropriate species for the site. Unfortunately C. macrocarpa is
      particularly susceptible to the disease, suffering branch and stem
      dieback. (For more information click <a href="http://www.nzffa.org.nz/pests/diseases/Cypress_canker/Cypress_canker.html">here</a>)<br><br>
      
      The decision was made to apply a tonne of boron, not only to the
      macrocarpas but also to two small blocks of pines. The boron was
      applied by helicopter in xxx 2008 [???], and within six months the
      change was dramatic.<br><br>
      
      The trees have gone from what John describes as a &ldquo;sickly
      yellowy-green&rdquo; to a better, healthier green and the canker
      has seemed to not get any worse, he says John. He believes the boron
      does seem to have controlled the disease, with only a few trees showing
      lingering signs of yellowing. His plan is to let the stand stabilise
      then thin out the affected stems and finish pruning the good trees.<br><br>
      
      Although the Prebbles did a lot of planting early on, woodlot planting
      has virtually ceased in recent years so John can complete pruning and
      thinning on the existing stands. He&rsquo;s used contractors in the
      past as well as doing a lot of the work himself, but says
      he&rsquo;ll finish doing the &ldquo;tidying up&rdquo;
      himself. With son Mark now leasing the farm, John sees future timber
      sales as an aid to succession planning, although any further planting
      will most likely be more shelter.<br>
      
      <h4>Fodder</h4>
      
      <img style="width: 345px; height: 232px; float: left; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" alt="" src="/images/design/DSC_39910734.jpg" border="1">The
      Prebbles&rsquo; interest in planting poplars for stock fodder
      started back in 1989, when they planted 500 Flevo (P. deltoides x
      nigra) wands supplied by the Otago Catchment Board. The 1.5 ha block
      was established and managed purely as a way of feeding stock during
      drought.<br><br>
      
      Reading the handbook Growing Poplar and Willow Trees on Farms, it seems
      Flevo would not normally be regarded as the ideal species for sites
      prone to mid-summer drought and has since been superceded by newer
      clones. However it is recommended as a fodder resource because of its
      large leaves and many branches.<br><br>
      
      In 1998, under severe drought conditions, 33 steers were fed 10 trees
      every day, with results that have since been described as
      &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; by the Ballance Award regional
      co-ordinator Rhys Millar.<br><br>
      
      John says the cattle did do quite well, although they did damage the
      trees. He only puts sheep in there now because cattle stripped the bark
      off so badly. Last autumn he ran around 300 ewes in the block. The
      trees have recovered quite quickly and are coming away again well, and
      will be available to feed off in two years time.<br><br>
      
      <img style="width: 337px; height: 273px; float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" alt="" src="/images/design/DSC_39890732.jpg" border="1">In 2004 John
      helped Barrie Wills of Central Environmental Services,
      Alexandra, and land and forest consultant Murray Harris set up a trial
      with a grant from the Sustainable Farming Fund (SFF Project #04/089) to
      evaluate the effects of simple practical pruning treatments on tree
      fodder production and possible leaf retention. The project looked at
      quantifying dry matter yield and analysed the quality of the feed.<br><br>
      
      Well-placed fencing for maximum animal control during grazing is seen
      as the key to good utilisation of tree fodder. The trial concluded that
      autumn pruning produced greater biomass within the relatively short two
      growing season period from pruning to harvest. Eliminating smaller
      branches during pruning improved yield initially but was eventually
      offset by a decrease in edible fodder. In his report on the project
      Barry Wills says when trimming larger trees for the first time
      horizontal cuts should be avoided, as it restricts wound healing and
      meristem development (from which new branches arise).<br><br>
      
      The treatments applied to the trees had a negligible effect on leaf
      retention at the end of the growing season and using combinations of
      different poplar species or cultivars was seen as a more effective way
      of extending the fodder supply.<br><br>
      
      In 2006 John and Heather received a special regional Ballance Award in
      recognition of their work with the project.
