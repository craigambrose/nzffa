Feature: Subscriptions
  Subscriptions are the way that NZFFA members belong to groups
  Subscriptions last for a year and all begin on the same date
  Readers can buy a subscription
  The price of a subscription depends on what membership choices the reader has made
  Readers buy subscriptions via the web interface, which calculates the price of the subscription as members make choices
  There needs to be a class that adds, removes groups from the reader depending on their subscription details
